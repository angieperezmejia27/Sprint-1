        <h1 id="page2-main-title"> How to Plant Pink Lilies</h1>
        <p id="page2-p">As a part of the Lilium genus, pink lilies grow from bulbs. 
            Placing the bulb deeper in the soil allows for sturdy roots 
            and helps the bulb stay cool when the temperature rises. 
            Adding a layer of mulch can also help keep the bulbs cool, 
            especially if you’re heading into the winter months. </p>

        <ol id="howTo">
            <li> You can find lily bulbs in many stores, and they can even be bought online from various independent sellers.  </li>
            <li> Plant three to four bulbs in loosened soil at 12 to 15 inches. Place the flat side of the bulb down and the pointy end up. </li>
            <li> Space the bulbs at least 8 inches from each other to avoid crowding.</li>
            <li> Gently pat the soil down as you fill the hole around the bulb with enriched soil. </li>
            <li> Water the soil thoroughly when planting, continuing to keep the soil moist.
